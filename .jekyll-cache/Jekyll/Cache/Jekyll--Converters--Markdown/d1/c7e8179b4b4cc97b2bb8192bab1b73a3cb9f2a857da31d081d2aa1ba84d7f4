I"3<p>The goal of this meetup was to setup a specch recognizer to answer queries from the <a href="https://tech.instacart.com/3-million-instacart-orders-open-sourced-d40d29ead6f2">InstaKart dataset</a>. We divide the 
problem into 3 parts, of which we have achieved only the first two.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Find a speech recognition API and make it work.</li>
  <li>Query on a given product information. More specifically, recognize a product name and look for similar products in the dataset and return the location of the product.</li>
  <li>Make the products returned in part 2 relevant. Beef up the speech recognition to get semantic meaning.</li>
</ol>

<p>The first part was more complicated than expected. Eventually we made it work, the idea is to download the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/SpeechRecognition/">Python Speech Recognition API</a> and all its required dependencies, in particular we need pyaudio to get audio from a microphone.</p>

<p>For the second part we download the InstaKart data and create methods that lookup for a key word among all the products. See more details <a href="https://github.com/TorontoDataScientistsWithoutBorders/speech_recognition_InstaKart/blob/master/speech.ipynb">here</a>.</p>
